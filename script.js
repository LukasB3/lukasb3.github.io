        description: `I created a Crypto Information Dashboard for the year 2023. The dashboard displays information about 
        10 cryptocurrencies. Current information about each crypto currency is displayed (e.g. current price, market cap, 
        percentage change from all-time high, etc).<br>Historical data is also displayed in the form of graphs or bar charts,
        e.g. the historical price on the respective date, the number of trades per day, as well as the trend for the year 2023.
        The data is retrieved from the Binance API and the coingecko API.<br><br>In addition, the 5 most recent tweets for each 
        cryptocurrency are displayed, as well as a sentiment of the last 50 tweets for each cryptocurrency. The data for this 
        comes from the Twitter Developer API.<br><br>Everything was visualized with the help of Dash Plotly. Libraries used are:
        requests (to handle the API requests), pandas (to process the data), textblob (for natural language processing and 
        sentiment analysis).`,

        description:`I have developed an application that allows you to predict the price of a used car. The data for this comes 
        from a dataset from Autoscout24.<br> The website asks the user for some input variables (make, model, fuel, mileage, year)
        and then predicts the probable price. Additionally, another page can be displayed to visualize the dataset.<br><br>For this,
        the dataset had to be preprocessed. Then, a GridSearch was used to determine the most optimal model possible. To evaluate 
        the model, the mse and the r2-score were then used. The model was then saved using the pickle library. <br><br> The user 
        interface and web deployment was done using Streamlit. Libraries used are: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn.`,

        description: `Created a simple chat room for writing. When a user clicks on the website, he is first asked for his username 
        and a PIN. After that, a specific chat room related to the PIN opens and users can communicate with each other in real time.
        <br> In addition, the chat is stored in a mongoDB database and can be accessed at a later time using the same PIN. <br><br>
        To implement this I used the Flask framework. With the help of the Flask-SocketIO extension I realized the real-time, 
        bidirectional communication between web clients and server. Flask-PyMongo was used to link the Flask application to the mongoDB
        database and work with it.<br><br>The user interface was implemented in 2 html files, deployment was done with Heroku. 
        Libraries used are: flask, flask_pymongo, flask_socketio, waitress, pytz. `,

        description: `Currently I am working on this project. I want to create a website that forecasts weather data for Ulm hourly for 
        the next 24 hours. The data for this comes from the openweather API and the Solcast API. In addition, solar radiation should also
        be predicted, so that homeowners with solar systems can better plan their energy consumption. <br><br>
        The basic architecture is shown in the diagram on the left and is already partly in place. Since it is a multi-output time-series
        forecasting problem and that is still complex for me, I am currently still trying out which machine learning model makes the most 
        sense here.<br><br> Libraries used so far are: pandas, numpy, pymongo, scikit-learn, pytorch.` ,
